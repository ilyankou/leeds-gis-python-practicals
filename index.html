      Agent-Based Modelling in Python
    </h1>

    <p>
      This is a practice model that creates agents who can interact with an environment.
      Put simply, we let X agents onto the field and see them eat stuff.
      The program can run with GUI, showing the progress of the agents in
      an animation using <code>matplotlib</code> library, or output the resulting environment into a file.

    </p>

    <h2 class="f2">What is the environment? ðŸ—º</h2>

    <p>
      The environment is the "world" for our agent-based model.
      It is defined as a CSV-formatted file with
      integers corresponding to cell values of the environment.
      Depending on the problem, the values can be elevation, amount of available resource,
      temperature, etc.
    </p>
      
    <p>
      In this implementation, the environment is read from the
      <a href="https://github.com/ilyankou/leeds-gis-python-practicals/blob/master/in.txt" class="code link blue">in.txt</a> file.
      To change the environment, simply edit in.txt in any text editor. Make sure it is a proper rectangle (that is,
      the same number of values in each row), with no missing values.
    </p>

    <h4 class="f4 mb2">Example of a 5&times;5 environment</h4>
    <p class="mt0">
      Here, the minimum value is 1 at (y=1, x=4), and the maximum value is 785 at (y=3, x=2).
    </p>
    <p class="code pa3 bg-near-white">
      200,2,201,100,3<br>
      200,15,201,100,1<br>
      200,12,201,100,44<br>
      15,220,785,41,16<br>
      7,220,451,100,41 
    </p>

    <h2 class="f2">Who are the agents? ðŸ¤–</h2>
    <p>
      The agents are individual entities that interact with the environment.
      In this implementation, you can define both the number of agents and,
      if desired, their initial locations within the environment.
    </p>

    <p>
      Currently, the model parses the x and y coordinates of agents
      <a href="http://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/courses/computing/practicals/python/agent-framework/part9/data.html" class="link blue">
        from this HTML page</a> using Python's <code>BeautifulSoup</code> library.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        The model uses the first <code>N</code> (y, x) pairs of coordinates from the HTML page.
        The model checks to make sure the coordinates fall within the environment dimensions (if not, the program
        outputs an error and terminates).
      </li>
      <li>
        In case the number of agents (<code>num_of_agents</code>) is larger than there are
        coordinates defined in the HTML page, the model
        <a href="https://github.com/ilyankou/leeds-gis-python-practicals/blob/master/model/agentframework.py#L58-L59" class="link blue">
          will assign random (y, x) coordinates</a> to the remaining agents. The model makes sure
          the coordinates fall within the boundaries of the rectangular environment.
        </li>

    </ul>

    <p>
      The coordinates can be manually changed after initialization using <code>set_x()</code> and <code>set_y()</code>
      setters of <code>Agent</code> class (from model/<i>agentframework.py</i>). When new x/y coordinates are set,
      the model makes sure they fall within the boundaries of the environment.
    </p>
    
    <h2 class="f2">How do I run the model?</h2>
    <p>There are <b>three ways</b> you can run this model: with animation, without animation, and batch runs.</p>

    <h3 class="f3">Running with GUI</h3>

    <p>
      The simplest way to start the program in GUI is to run the following in the terminal:
    </p>

    <p class="code bg-lightest-blue pa3">
      python model num_of_agents num_of_iterations neighbourhood
    </p>

    <p>
      where <code>num_of_agents</code> is the number of agents,
      <code>num_of_iterations</code> is the number of iterations (steps each agent takes),
      and <code>neighbourhood</code> is the distance of the neighbourhood
      (agents are social creatures and like sharing their food
      with neighbours who are at most neighbourhood units far).
    </p>

    <p>
      So to run a model with 5 agents and 10 iterations, with the
      neighbourhood size of 2, run <code class="bg-near-white">python model 5 10 2</code>.
      This command will open up a window. In the menu, go to <b>Model &rarr; Run model</b>
      to start the animation. You can repeat the interaction as many times as you wish
      to see the environment change further.
    </p>


    <h3 class="f3">Running in "quiet" mode</h3>

    <p>
      If you add nodisplay as the fourth parameter to the command, like this:
    </p>

    <p class="code bg-washed-yellow pa3">
      python model 5 10 2 nodisplay
    </p>

    <p>
      the program won't show the GUI. Instead, it will write the output in two files.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li> <code class="bg-near-white">output/5-10-2.txt</code>, which has a similar structure to the in.txt file,
        represents the state of the environment at the end of the run.
        5, 10 and 2 values are the model's parameters as described above.</li>
      <li>
        <code class="bg-near-white">output/stored.txt</code> get a record of the total amount of food
        stored by all agents. The file doesn't get overwritten, but
        instead a new line with a single number gets appended to the end.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3 class="f3">Performing multiple runs with various parameters</h3>

    <p>
      More experienced users might want to run the model with multiple
      parameters to compare resulting environments. They can manually
      change the <code class="bg-near-white">model/run_model.py</code> file to set the range of values for the
      number of agents, number of iterations, and the neighbourhood distance.
      To run, simply execute the following in the console:
    </p>

    <p class="pa3 code bg-washed-green">
      python model/run_model.py
    </p>

    <p>
      This script makes use of the <code>subprocess</code> library of Python to run
      the model with various parameters. The output environments are
      recorded in the <b>output</b> folder under file names consistent to
      the model's parameters (eg <code class="bg-near-white">5-10-2.txt</code>).
    </p>

    <h2 class="f2">Model Results</h2>

      run with different parameters.
