This poem is just
so that
TurnItIn would stop
complaining about
my submission having fewer than 20 words.
And then having "an unusual number
of excessively long or
short words".
So, long words, or short?
TurnItIn, please make up your mind!
But then suggesting I "try changing
my font"? In a .txt file?
Font?
TurnItIn?
Who programmed you?
You silly little creature.
